## Our Goal is to answer this question Is there a difference between the alcohol consumed between the row
## you choose to sit in??

## Now with ggplot - first select the basic data


## Now add in boxplot
```{r}
boxplot(alcohol~Seat,data=davisdata)
```

The boxes are not disjoint. In the boxplot, the median of the back box is higher than that of the front and middle boxes. The front and middle boxes exhibit similar sizes, though the middle box contains a greater number of outliers compared to the front box.  
  
  

## Numerical Summarys

```{r}
favstats(alcohol~Seat,data=ucdavis1)
```



## Inferential Tests

## Conclusions
